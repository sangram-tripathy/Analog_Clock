# Analog_Clock
This project is an interactive analog clock built with three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time using traditional analog clock hands (hour, minute, and second) and updates in real-time. Here's an overview of how each technology contributes to the project:

1. HTML (Structure)
The HTML provides the basic structure of the analog clock. It creates the container for the clock face and the individual hands (hour, minute, second). Here's how it works:

Clock Container: The div elements are used to represent the clock's circular face and individual clock hands.
Clock Hands: Separate div elements are created for the hour, minute, and second hands. These hands are positioned and rotated using CSS and JavaScript.
Additional Elements: Optionally, you could add elements like a digital time display or labels if needed.

2. CSS (Styling & Positioning)
CSS is used to style the clock, giving it a realistic appearance. It involves creating the circular shape of the clock face and positioning the hands in their proper places. Additionally, CSS animations or transitions are used to smoothly rotate the clock hands.

Hands: The hands (hour, minute, second) are styled as thin bars, and their rotation is done using transform: rotate().
Positioning: The clock hands are positioned in the center of the clock face using absolute positioning, and their rotation is done relative to their center point.
Animations: Smooth rotations are achieved by animating the hands via CSS or JavaScript to update the handsâ€™ positions.

3. JavaScript (Functionality)
JavaScript is used to calculate the current time and update the position of the clock hands accordingly. It continuously tracks the real-time time and adjusts the hands' positions by rotating them. The rotation is achieved by setting the transform property for each hand.

Current Time: The JavaScript Date object is used to retrieve the current hour, minute, and second.
Rotation Calculation: The angles for each hand (hour, minute, second) are calculated based on the current time. The angles are then applied to the respective clock hand using JavaScript.
Update Mechanism: The clock hands update every second, ensuring that the time is always accurate.
